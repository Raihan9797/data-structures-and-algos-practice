# Python Data Structures and Algorithms Practice
A place for me to store:

1. Codewars / Leetcode / Kattis etc code
    Each question will include:
        1. Question description
        2. Input Output Example
        3. What I personally learnt from the code (technical and non-technical)
        4. My own solution
        5. A better solution (if i have found any)

2. Implementations of certain algorithms and Data Structures
